Tricks and treachery are the practice of fools, that don't have brains enough to be honest.
Any fool can criticize, condemn and complain and most fools do.
A learned blockhead is a greater blockhead than an ignorant one.
The man who doesn't read good books has no advantage over the man who can't read them.
Empty pockets never held anyone back. Only empty heads and empty hearts can do that.
Never tell people how to do things. Tell them what to do, and they will surprise you with their ingenuity.
Always do everything you ask of those you command.
